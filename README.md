Bootstrapped from anurudhp's [2022 attempt](https://github.com/anurudhp/aoc2022). Would like to add some automation for puzzle pulling when I get time.

## General notes
+ Some small optimizations in Day02 that could be simple enough for a proof.
+ Didn't know Parsec was a thing, so I hand rolled a DFA for Day03 (pain). Included a Parsec solution with help from Kiran's great [solutions](https://github.com/kiranandcode/lean-aoc).
+ In general not very cleaned up and rushed (hopefully I'll get some time to clean them up soon TM).
